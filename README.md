# top-down-rpg


Ye we just big hyped


you start the game
you get the blacksmith and shop form ur great grand father

You need to gather recources to make your first 

Ideas:

intro scene: comes to a boat while looking like they had a rough time. (holes in his clothes_


will bring lunch box to mayor (man of wife from the shop) therefore will get to chose 2 pieces of clothing (shoes?, Shirt?, trousers?)
mayors asks what he is doing here, tells he wants to work here, mayor gives him a small broken house in the woods, he has to fix the house, he will becomee a carpenter for the small village up road, after he visits the house he will go back for clothing and after he got his clothing will go to the mayor again and asks if he can do small (household) jobs to get a "coin" to buy his first axe to clean up some trees and make the house look better, 

(ship was wrecked only one to survive, got here after a rowring for a while)

village: NO HOME for them, 3 buildings total (he will be the carpenter), 1 clothing shop, 1 house (mayors house)


gets some free clotes, 
soft, aesthetic style, top down rpg
cut down trees, with and axe, differents types of axes or pickaxes (flint, stone, iron)
